    <h1>Software Engineering Concepts</h1>
    
    <h2>What is <span class="highlight">Software</span>? (سافٹ ویئر کیا ہے؟)</h2>
    <p><span class="keyword">Software</span> is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It encompasses everything from system software like operating systems and utilities, which manage and maintain the computer itself, to application software like word processors and games, which perform tasks for the user.</p>
    <p>Software can be broadly classified into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>System software:</strong> Includes <span class="keyword">operating systems</span>, device drivers, and utilities that manage hardware and basic system operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Application software:</strong> Encompasses programs designed for <span class="keyword">end-users</span> to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, web browsing, and database management.</li>
        <li><strong>Middleware:</strong> Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system, often used to enable <span class="keyword">communication</span> and <span class="keyword">data management</span> in distributed systems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What is <span class="highlight">Software Engineering</span>? (سافٹ ویئر انجینئرنگ کیا ہے؟)</h2>
    <p><span class="keyword">Software Engineering</span> is a disciplined approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It applies <span class="keyword">engineering principles</span> and practices to ensure software is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and meets user requirements. The field encompasses various stages and methodologies of software development, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirements analysis:</strong> Understanding and documenting what the <span class="keyword">users</span> need and expect from the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Planning the structure and components of the software, including system architecture and <span class="keyword">user interfaces</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation (coding):</strong> Writing the actual <span class="keyword">code</span> according to the design specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Verifying that the software functions as intended and identifying and fixing <span class="keyword">defects</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Ongoing support and improvement of the software after its initial release, including <span class="keyword">bug fixes</span> and adding new features.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Functional and Non-Functional Requirements in <span class="highlight">Software Engineering</span> (سافٹ ویئر انجینئرنگ میں فنکشنل اور نان-فنکشنل ضروریات)</h2>
    <p>In <span class="keyword">software engineering</span>, <span class="keyword">requirements</span> are crucial for defining what the software system should do and how it should perform. These requirements are typically categorized into <span class="keyword">functional</span> and <span class="keyword">non-functional</span> requirements.</p>
    
    <h3>Functional Requirements (فنکشنل ضروریات)</h3>
    <p><span class="keyword">Functional requirements</span> describe what the system should do. They outline the specific behaviors, functions, and features that the software must possess to meet the needs of its users. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> The system must allow users to <span class="keyword">log in</span> and <span class="keyword">log out</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The system must <span class="keyword">process</span> input data and produce the expected output.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> The system must <span class="keyword">generate reports</span> based on user inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Management:</strong> The system must handle <span class="keyword">transactions</span>, such as sales or purchases, ensuring they are processed correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> The system must allow users to interact with it through a <span class="keyword">user interface</span>, like forms or buttons.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Non-Functional Requirements (نان-فنکشنل ضروریات)</h3>
    <p><span class="keyword">Non-functional requirements</span> describe how the system should perform and its qualities. These requirements focus on the operational aspects of the system and its constraints rather than specific behaviors. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The system must process transactions within <span class="keyword">2 seconds</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system must support up to <span class="keyword">10,000 concurrent users</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> The system must ensure <span class="keyword">data encryption</span> for sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The system must be <span class="keyword">user-friendly</span> and intuitive for users of all skill levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The system must have an <span class="keyword">uptime</span> of 99.9% over a year.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The system must allow for easy <span class="keyword">updates</span> and maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> The system must work on various platforms, such as <span class="keyword">Windows</span>, <span class="keyword">macOS</span>, and <span class="keyword">Linux</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The <span class="highlight">Agile Model</span> in Software Development (سافٹ ویئر ڈویلپمنٹ میں ایجائل ماڈل)</h2>
    <p>The <span class="keyword">Agile model</span> is a method used in software development that focuses on delivering small, workable parts of the project quickly and continuously improving them based on feedback. Here are the key points of the Agile model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Iterative Process:</strong> Agile development is done in small, repeatable cycles called <span class="keyword">iterations</span> or <span class="keyword">sprints</span>. Each sprint usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Incremental Development:</strong> In each iteration, a small part of the software is developed, tested, and delivered. This allows for quick releases of functional software.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Agile allows for changes and improvements at any stage. If requirements change, the team can adapt easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Collaboration:</strong> Customers or users are closely involved throughout the project. Their feedback is regularly collected and used to shape the product.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Functional Teams:</strong> Agile teams are made up of members with different skills, such as developers, testers, and designers, who work together to complete each iteration.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> After each sprint, the team reviews what went well and what could be better. This process, called a <span class="keyword">retrospective</span>, helps the team improve their work and processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Working Software:</strong> The main measure of progress is working software. Each iteration should result in a usable piece of software, even if it's just a small part of the final product.</li>
        <li><strong>User Stories:</strong> Requirements are often written as <span class="keyword">user stories</span>, which describe how the software will be used from the perspective of the end-user.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Stand-Up Meetings:</strong> Teams have short daily meetings to discuss what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any obstacles they're facing.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Quality:</strong> Agile practices emphasize <span class="keyword">testing</span> throughout development to catch and fix bugs early, ensuring the finalproduct is of high quality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Differences Between <span class="highlight">Waterfall</span>, <span class="highlight">Iterative</span>, and <span class="highlight">Agile</span> Models (واٹر فال، ایٹریٹو، اور ایجائل ماڈلز کے درمیان فرق)</h2>
    <p>In software development, different models are used to plan and manage projects. The most common models are Waterfall, Iterative, and Agile. Each model has its own approach and workflow.</p>
    
    <h3>Waterfall Model (واٹر فال ماڈل)</h3>
    <p>The <span class="keyword">Waterfall model</span> is a linear and sequential approach. It consists of distinct phases that must be completed one after another. Here are its main features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phases:</strong> The project is divided into phases: <span class="keyword">requirements</span>, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with no overlap.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Detailed documentation is created at each phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Changes are difficult to make once a phase is completed, making it less <span class="keyword">flexible</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Used in projects where requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change, such as construction or manufacturing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Iterative Model (ایٹریٹو ماڈل)</h3>
    <p>The <span class="keyword">Iterative model</span> involves repeating cycles (iterations) where parts of the system are developed, tested, and improved upon. Here are its main features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phases Repeated:</strong> The project goes through multiple iterations, each including planning, design, coding, and testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Each iteration builds on the previous one, allowing for feedback and refinements.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Changes can be made more easily compared to the Waterfall model.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototypes:</strong> Often used to create prototypes that evolve over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Suitable for large projects where requirements may evolve, such as in software development and R&D.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Agile Model (ایجائل ماڈل)</h3>
    <p>The <span class="keyword">Agile model</span> is similar to the Iterative model but with a stronger emphasis on flexibility, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement. Its key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sprints:</strong> The project is divided into small, time-boxed iterations called sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> Each sprint results in a functional piece of software.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Involvement:</strong> Frequent customer feedback and involvement throughout the development process.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Functional Teams:</strong> Teams with various skills work together closely.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Highly adaptable to changing requirements and focuses on continuous improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, like web and mobile app development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary of Differences (فرق کا خلاصہ)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> Linear and sequential with fixed phases, less flexible, suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Model:</strong> Cyclical approach with repeated iterations, more flexible, allows for ongoing refinements and prototyping.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile Model:</strong> Highly flexible and iterative, focuses on small, frequent releases and continuous improvement, with strong customer involvement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each model has its strengths and is suitable for different types of projects depending on the requirements, complexity, and need for flexibility.</p>
